# EDPostcards_BOT
A twitter bot made to retweet a single and unique hashtag ! 

Hello people ! I'm Foxlider. 
About a year ago (about 2016) I created the #EDPostcards on Twitter. It started to gain quite a reputation. 
But now I want people to be able to receive easily what people tweet on the hashtag whenever somebody tweet. 

And this lil BOT is born. THE END


# Installation : 
  - Just get the keys from twitter (CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_KEY, ACCESS_SECRET) 
  - Put them in a file called keyFile.txt in this EXACT order ! 
  - Create an 'dl' folder
  - Launch the BOT
  - TADAAAAA !

But honestly, why would you run this bot if mine is already running ?

# Commands
  - shutdown    : To shutdown the BOT (quite obvious)
  - tweet [txt] : To send a tweet via the bot's console. txt is the message of the tweet.

THE END
